# Pie Chart / Masthead

A TTS assignment - **[Live Demo](https://jordanmor.github.io/piechart-masthead)**

**Goal:** Build a pie chart and masthead to spec using only CSS & HTML

**Instructions**
1. Build out the pie chart seen in the image using only HTML and CSS (no images!)
2. Set the background color of each section to the color it is labeled
3. Build out the masthead seen in the image masthead.png
4. Use the 'cart-icon.png' and 'search-icon.png' images; everything else should just be HTML and
CSS

**Notes**  
For this assignment, attention was placed on producing clear, readable CSS code by adhering to the DRY principle.  

Another personal goal was to utilize CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox to achieve proper placement of elements on the page, as well as CSS variables to achieve better code maintainability.

Finally, I wanted to have some fun creating a CSS animation on the pie chart
